# Odd and Even Number Sum Calculator

## Description

This JavaScript program calculates the **sum of all odd numbers** between two given values, and the **sum of all even numbers** between another pair of values.

## Given

```javascript
const oddStart = 1000;
const oddEnd = 2000;

const evenStart = 500;
const evenEnd = 800;
```

## Goal

    Calculate the sum of all odd numbers between oddStart and oddEnd (inclusive).

    Calculate the sum of all even numbers between evenStart and evenEnd (inclusive).

    Store the total of both sums in a single variable:
    
```
let sum;
```

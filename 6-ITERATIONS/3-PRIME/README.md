# Prime Number Checker

## Description

This JavaScript program checks whether a given number is a **prime number**.

A **prime number** is a number that is divisible **only by 1 and itself** â€” it has exactly two distinct positive divisors.

For example:

- `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, and `809` are prime numbers.
- `4`, `6`, `9`, and `100` are not prime numbers.

## Given

```javascript
const n = 809;
```

Goal

Determine whether the number n is a prime number.

Store the result (true or false) in a boolean variable:

let isPrime;

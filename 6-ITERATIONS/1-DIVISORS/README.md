# Divisors Finder

## Description

This simple JavaScript program finds and logs all the divisors of a given number.

A **divisor** of a number `n` is any number that divides `n` exactly, leaving **no remainder**.

For example, `100` is a divisor of `300` because `300 รท 100 = 3` with no remainder.

## Given

```javascript
const n = 300;
```

# Goal

Find and log all the divisors of the number n one by one.

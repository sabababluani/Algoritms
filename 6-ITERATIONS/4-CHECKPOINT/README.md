# Checkpoint Tracker Game

## Description

This JavaScript program simulates a game where a hero moves from the start (0 km) to a finish line at `100 km`. Along the way, there are 4 checkpoints. As the hero reaches each checkpoint, a message is displayed. When the hero reaches the finish line, a final congratulatory message is logged.

## Given

```javascript
const checkpoints = [10, 20, 50, 60];
const finish = 100;
```

Goal

    Simulate the hero's journey from 0 to finish using a for loop.

    When the hero reaches a checkpoint, log a message like:

Congratulations! You reached the x km checkpoint

After reaching the finish line, log:

Congratulations! You crossed the finish line at 100 km

# Reversed String

This project involves writing a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

## Function Signature

```javascript
function reverse(string) {}
```

Description

The reverse function should return the reversed version of the input string.

It should:

    Keep all characters, including spaces and punctuation, in reversed order.

    Preserve case (uppercase and lowercase letters should not be altered).

Example Usage

```javascript
reverse("Hello"); // "olleH"
reverse("I'm gonna win"); // "niw annog m'I"
```

Notes

    Do not use built-in .reverse() on the string directly (though converting to an array is fine).

    Make sure your function works with any character, including symbols and whitespace.

# FizzBuzz

## Task Description

You are given a number variable:

```js
const n = 50;
```

Your task is to check the value of the variable and print (log) to the console:

- If the number is divisible by **3**, print `"Fizz"`.
- If the number is divisible by **5**, print `"Buzz"`.
- If the number is divisible by **both 3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
- If the number is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, print the number itself.

## Example

For `n = 50`:

- Since 50 is divisible by 5, the output should be:

```
Buzz
```

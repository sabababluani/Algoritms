# Sum of Diagonals II

We are given a 2D array. Its size can be 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, up to 15x15:

```js
const array2d = [
  [5, 10, 20, 1],
  [3, 50, 17, 2],
  [0, 18, -10, 3],
  [1, 22, 34, 4],
];
```

Calculate the sum of both diagonals and store the result in the variable:

```js
let sumOfDiagonals;
```

- Primary diagonal = top-left to bottom-right
- Secondary diagonal = top-right to bottom-left

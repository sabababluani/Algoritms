# Rectangle Area Comparison

## Task Description

You are given two rectangles with the following dimensions:

```js
const width1 = 100;
const length1 = 10;

const width2 = 50;
const length2 = 15;
```

## Your Task

Check if the **area of the first rectangle** is greater than the **area of the second rectangle**.

Store the result as a **boolean value** in the variable named:

```js
let firstIsBigger;
```

## Example

To calculate the area of a rectangle, use the formula:

```
area = width Ã— length
```

So in this case:

- Area of the first rectangle = `100 * 10 = 1000`
- Area of the second rectangle = `50 * 15 = 750`

Since `1000 > 750`, the variable should be:

```js
let firstIsBigger = true;
```

# Bracket Nesting Validator

Your task is to create a function called `checkNest(string)` which checks whether a given string of brackets is **properly nested**.

## Function Signature

```javascript
function checkNest(string) {
  // your code here
}
```

Input

```
The string consists only of the following characters:

    ( and )

    { and }

    [ and ]
```

A string is considered valid if:

    Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Brackets are closed in the correct order, like HTML/XML tag nesting.

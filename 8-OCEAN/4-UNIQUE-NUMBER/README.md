# Find the Unique Number

You are given an array where every number appears **exactly twice**, **except one** number, which appears only once.

Your task is to create a function called `unique(array)` that finds and returns the number that appears only once.

## Input Example

```javascript
const couples = [10, 5, 10, 13, 5, 12, 13];
```
